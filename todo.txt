--how to not pass ResponseEntity from the service layer ???? - answer is to handle all exceptions in a separate place
- custom exception handler to handle exceptions and translate them to HTTP status codes (16h)
-- what is better ControllerAdvice or DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver with reconfiguring
all spring exception handling (pros and cons) - answer is that controller advice can handle all exception
so I guess follow the KISS principle
